# Numbers in Text
A dynamically updated research survey on representing numbers in Natural Language Processing. 
Developed by [Eshaan Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshaan-aggarwal/). Survey contributions by [Avijit Thawani](https://avi-jit.github.io/) and [Swaroop Mishra](https://swarooprm.github.io/). Thanks to the Semantic Scholar API for citation counts.

You can preview the [Notion Database here](https://www.notion.so/4fdead36e192423594f079253f59234f).

## About this repository
This repository primarily hosts two files:
1. `records.json`: The description of the Notion Database and all the entries in it in the form a `.json` file.
2. `database.csv`: This file contains the important details about all the papers, as well as some additional information (such as the citations and references of each paper) not stored in the Notion page, in a `.csv` format.

This repository also hosts a github action which periodically updates the citation and reference data of the papers in the repository as well as the Notion page.

## Thanks
This project wouldn't have been possible without the [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api), [Notion API](https://notionapi.readme.io/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)!
